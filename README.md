[Complexity is killing software developers](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3639050/complexity-is-killing-software-developers.html)

## A paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article

This article is interesting that it explains the way that the growing complexity of software systems could kill developers. It provides some insights about the current and future software development environment.

## Dana Sun's Edit

It's interesting that the article seems to imply that the rate at which technologies are advancing is far too quick, to the point where we may not be able to keep up with such. Given that the complexity of technology is created by our society, it's ironic that society can't keep up with its own creations.
